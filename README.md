Here is a random collection of scripts for qc'ing metadata on cgap.

Assumptions:
   * you have a `~/keypairs.json` file with a valid `"cgaptest"` key.
   * you have some version of these libraries in your environment.
      * matplotlib
      * numpy
      * pandas
      * dcicutils

The only other set up required should be adding `code/` to your
`$PYTHONPATH`.
